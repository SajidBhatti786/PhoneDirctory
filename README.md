# PhoneDirectory

PhoneDirectory is a Java application that simulates a phone directory, allowing users to store and manage contact information. It utilizes various data structures to efficiently store and retrieve data, including HashMap, Binary Search Tree (BST), and LinkedList.

## Features

- Add a new contact with name and phone number.
- Search for a contact by name or phone number.
- Update contact details such as name or phone number.
- Delete a contact from the directory.
- Display all contacts in alphabetical order or by phone number.
- Import and export contacts to/from a file for data persistence.

## Data Structures

The PhoneDirectory application utilizes the following data structures:

- HashMap: Used for fast lookup of contacts by name, ensuring constant-time complexity for retrieval and storage.
- Binary Search Tree (BST): Used to maintain contacts in sorted order by phone number, enabling efficient searching and retrieval operations.
- LinkedList: Used for storing contacts in the order they were added, facilitating insertion and deletion of contacts.
